# JavaFX-Login-Form
A login form example with database access and password hashing using JavaFX. \
This project was built using Netbeans IDE.

### NOTE:
The code still contains my database server and credentials; I have deleted the database after this project was completed and have left it in the code as an example.

### Features:
* Creating new users, hashing the passwords into a database (with username and password columns), checking if username already exists
* Logging in, which compares the hashed password with the hashed input from the password field at login time (and returns either invalid password or login successful)
